                <h2>🎨 Design Philosophy</h2>

                <h3>Interactive & Playful</h3>
                <p>
                    This site embraces interactivity and fun. From draggable polaroids to achievement badges,
                    I wanted to create something that feels alive and personal rather than just another static portfolio.
                </p>

                <h3>Content-First</h3>
                <p>
                    While the design is playful, content always comes first. Clean typography, good spacing,
                    and clear hierarchy ensure that what I'm sharing is easy to read and understand.
                </p>

                <h3>Performance Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Using Astro's islands architecture, most of the site is static HTML/CSS with JavaScript
                    only where needed. This results in fast load times and excellent Core Web Vitals scores.
                </p>

                <h2>✨ Key Features</h2>

                <h3>Achievement System</h3>
                <p>
                    Life is a game! I track my goals, milestones, and adventures as unlockable achievements.
                    Check out the <a href="/achievements">achievements page</a> to see what I've accomplished
                    and what I'm working towards.
                </p>

                <h3>Speaking Tracker</h3>
                <p>
                    All my <a href="/speaking">public talks and speaking engagements</a> in one place,
                    organized by year with details about the event, audience, and topics covered.
                </p>

                <h3>Curated Resources</h3>
                <p>
                    I maintain <a href="/resources">curated resources</a> - from startup tools to learning materials.
                    These are things I genuinely recommend and use.
                </p>

                <h3>Media Integration</h3>
                <p>
                    Books I'm reading from <a href="/books">Hardcover</a>, movies I'm watching from
                    <a href="/movies">Letterboxd</a>, and articles I'm saving via <a href="/bookmarks">Raindrop</a> -
                    all automatically synced and displayed.
                </p>

                <h2>🌟 Inspiration & Credits</h2>
                <p>
                    This website is built on top of the excellent codebase from

                    I've heavily customized and extended it with my own features, content, and design choices,
                    but the foundation and many of the interactive elements come from Robin's amazing work.
