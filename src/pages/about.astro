                <p class="lead">
                    Hi! I'm Rashad, an AI engineer, entrepreneur, and educator based in Malaysia.
                </p>

                <h2>👨‍💻 What I Do</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently the co-founder & CTO at <strong>Cleve</strong>, where we build AI-powered tools
                    that have reached over 100,000 users globally. My journey in tech started early - I began
                    hacking at age 11, entered university at 15, and have been building ever since.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond building products, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge through <a href="/speaking">public speaking</a>,
                    having delivered 20+ talks on AI, technology, and career development. I also create content
                    on <a href="https://tiktok.com/@rashadventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>
                    where I've built an audience of 20,000+ followers and generated over 5 million views.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm particularly interested in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning & AI</strong> - Building practical AI applications that solve real problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> - Creating products people love and building sustainable businesses</li>
                    <li><strong>Education & Community</strong> - Sharing knowledge and empowering the next generation of builders</li>
                    <li><strong>Adventure & Growth</strong> - Constantly trying new things and pushing boundaries</li>
                </ul>
